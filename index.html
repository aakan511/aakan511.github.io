      <h3>Building the Tractyl Manuform - One of the Strangest Keyboards on the Internet</h3>
      <img src="/assets/fullTractyl.21c43fc0.jpg">
      <p>Above is a fully assembled image of the Tractyl Manuform 5x6. Building this keyboard took around 100 hours of work. First, the curved design of the keyboard deck made it impossible to use a PCB, so I had to hand-solder the diodes to the hot-swappable key-switch holders and then use wires to create the keyboard matrix. Next, I had to somehow make the two halves communicate. For this, I used serial communication over a generic audio cable because the data throughput is small. Programming the Raspberry Pi Pico controllers was a challenge. I decided to use Python instead of C because it would allow me to change the code on the microcontrollers rather than recompiling firmware every time I made a change. The hardest part of the code was figuring out how to get the trackball to communicate with my computer, which I eventually figured out. 
      </p>
      <h4>Motivations:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Create an ergonomic keyboard to preserve wrist and shoulder health</li>
        <li>Integrate trackball in order to improve efficiency by not having to reach for a mouse</li>
        <li>Improve typing speed by having thumb clusters</li>
        <li>Build a "final" keyboard that would not be replaced for a long time</li>
      </ul>
      <img src="/assets/tractylWiring.3123470f.jpg">
      <p> Here is a picture of the inside of one of the halves of my Tractyl Manuform.</p>
      <h4>Technologies & STEM Concepts Used:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Circuit Design</li>
        <li>Hand Soldering</li>
        <li>Raspberry Pi</li>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>3D Printing (modeling, slicing)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>3D printing is my first advanced STEM hobby. I got my first 3D printer(the CR10S4 in the picture) in 2019 and have been mofyfing it along with another printer I got during the pandemic. 3D printing has helped me learn about many facets of engineering - from firmware development to soldering to 3D design.</p>

      <p>In April 2023, I led Team Salcedo for our second year competing in the Kibo Robot Programming Challenge. This year we won the national round, which allowed us to send our code to the ISS and compete internationally as NASA's representative. Unfortunately, an unforseen bug caused our program to crash right before finishing. Learning from this mistake will propel us to greater sucess next year! As the captain, I was responsible for organizing meetings and setting deadlines for each part of the code and helping my teammates as best I could. We were also fortunate enough to be able to work with some college students from Sri Lanka, which was an amazing experience for me because I learned a lot about their culture and programming, and I made some friends on the other side of the globe! In the competition, the main goal is to use image recognition to find and patch air leaks on the ISS.
        
        In 2022, Team Salcedo won 2nd place nationally in the third year of the Kibo Programming Challenge as team Salcedo. The first place team, Califorina Polytechnic State University's HSTAR, was able to watch their code run on one of the Astrobee robots in the International Space Station.   </p>

      <p>Around April, I led a team of my classmates to win 2nd place nationally in the third year of the Kibo Programming Challenge as team Salcedo. The first place team, Califorina Polytechnic State University's HSTAR, was able to watch their code run on one of the Astrobee robots in the International Space Station.

In the competition, the main goal is to use image recognition to find and patch air leaks on the ISS.  
        
        This challenge involves learning about image recognition through programming a robot to patch air leaks autonomously on the ISS.</p>

        <!--<img src="/assets/greenhouseTomatoesBig.jpeg" width="60%">-->
        <p>In this project, I co-lead a team of high-schoolers to design an aquaponics system, where fish waste is cycled through rock-based grow beds, resulting in a closed loop system that not only reduces water consumption by 95% compared to traditional agriculture, but also eliminates the need for soil. We also get to give back to the community through our partnership with a local food pantry, where we donate our harvests.</p>

        <h3>My 3D Printing Journey</h3>
        <img src="/assets/cr10s4.493fa03d.jpeg">
        <p>Above is a picture of the latest iteration of my CR10S4's hotend and extruder. This new design moves the extruder(motor on top) very close to the hotend, which not only allows faster printing but also gives me the ability to print flexible materials such as TPU. The mounting mechanisms are based on another design on Thingiverse.</p>
        <img src="/assets/sidewinder.3134b2b5.jpeg">
        <p> Here is a picture of my Evnovo Sidewinder X1. The white plastic piece on the hotend is a new fan mount that cools the molten plastic that comes out of the hotend faster, which allows quicker prints. Also, I replaced the mainboard of this system and reprogrammed it to use Klipper, which connects the printer to the internet and increases print speed and quality, while reducing noise. The pieces of styrofoam under the printer serve to dampen vibrations, which reduces the printer's noise.</p>

        <p>I recently decided to undertake an interesting project in computer science, which would challenge me to learn new programming languages (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). Since beginning this journey, I not only learned about coding a website, but also about network frameworks and how websites actually work.  </p>

        <h3>My (human) languages</h3>
        <p>In addition to STEM, I also enjoy learning human languages because it gives me a different perspective, and enables me to collabarate with different people. I learned to speak, read, and write in both Ukrainian and Russian from my parents. I'm very thankful to them for teaching me these beautiful languages because I'm now able to read classical Slavik litterature as well as make a deep connection with my Slavik heritage. In middle school, I chose to learn Japanese because I thought it was the most challenging language I could take. While I still have a lot more to learn, I really enjoy learning Japanese because it has highly structured grammar, which is intuitive to me. In high school, I began learning Chinese. I chose Chinese because I realized that I would be able to learn from more than a billion people I wouldn't have been able to learn from otherwise.</p>
        <h4>TLDR:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>I'm fluent in English, Russian, and Ukrainian</li>
          <li>I'm learning Japanese and Chinese</li>

        <p>While I don't think I will ever become a professional actor, I have enjoyed participating in several plays over the years. Starting in middle school, I would perform in a Slavik play yearly, which has been an enjoyable creative outlet.</p>

        <p>I began playing piano when I was about six years old. As I kept playing, I became more and more interterested in music and later began playing the classical guitar recreationally. </p>
